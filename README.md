Discord BetBot
===

## Intro

Worked on this bot to play around with Python. It was added to my class discord channel for fun.

What does it do?
---

You set up a bet. It then keeps track of the users choices. When the bet is over it calculates and stores participants debts and gains.
If someone pays his debt it can then be removed.
